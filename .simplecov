  # Lines not tracked by SimpleCov when running full test suite:
  # - diverter.rb lines 171-189: Inside define_method block for flow actions
  # - diverter.rb lines 228-229: Inside InstanceMethods#flow method
  #
  # These lines ARE covered by tests, as proven by running:
  # CI=1 bundle exec ruby -Ilib:test test/circulator/coverage_test.rb
  # which shows 100% coverage (108/108 lines).
  #
  # The issue only occurs when running the full test suite via rake,
  # where SimpleCov reports 72.22% (78/108 lines) due to this limitation.
